		name="Procedurally Generated Video"
		class="LCC2700 Introduction to Computational Media"
		description="Your assignment is to create a demo using Processing. The demo should include procedurally generated visuals and music. Your .pde file cannot be larger than 32k. Nothing over that size limit will be accepted. if you submit a project that has a .pde file over that limit, it will be given a zero. No instantial assets can be used EXCEPT font files. No wav / mp3 / bmp / avi / jpg / etc... files can be used in your project. The point of a demo is to generate the audiovisual experience, so you should focus on creating procedural definitions of both the audio and video. Audio in Processing is not its strong point, but we will make do."
