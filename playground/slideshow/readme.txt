Manual for web presenter

1. Ensure that the XML file is in the right location. If in doubt, check js/slideshow line 34.
2. Ensure that the index.html file is in the directory above /content and /js.
3. To launch the web presenter, point Safari or Chrome to the location of index.html.
4. JavaScript then does all the work and creates the presentation elements.
5. Use left and right arrow keys to advance to the slides to the left and right.
6. Use page up to go back to the future and page down to go back to the past. Careful with this at the ends of the history as it's buggy.
7. Use the mouse to hover and click items.
